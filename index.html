        <p>Hi there! My name is will and I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp for web development. 
            I am excited to try and gain the skills necessary to build 
            websites both on the front end and backend. The little programming knowledge I have are a few 
            pet projects with python so the opportunity to dive into popular web technologies such as javascript 
            will be very new and fun to try and grasp.</p>
            
        <p>When not programming my hobbies include golf and spending time with family. Working at a golf course 
            made the sport very accessible for me. I played a lot growing up and was lucky enough to play two 
            years in college. I enjoy spending time with family and love throwing a ball for my dog Buster at the park.</p>
